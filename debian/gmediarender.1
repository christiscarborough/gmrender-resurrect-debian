.SH NAME
gmediarender \- UPNP-AV renderer daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gmediarender
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B gmediarender
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBgmediarender\fP is a daemon which acts as a UPNP-AV renderer on the 
local network.  It can be controlled from a UPNP-AV control point to 
play media files from a UPNP-AV media server.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-friendly\-name
Friendly name to advertise on the network

Usually, it is desirable for the renderer 
to show up on controllers under a recognisable and unique name. This is 
the option to set that name.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-uuid
UUID to advertise on the network

This sets the UPNP UUID that  is advertised and used by controllers to 
distinguish different renderers.
Usually, \fBgmediarender\fP uses a built-in static id. 
If there are multiple renderers running on the local network, they will all 
share the same static ID.
With this option, each renderer can be given its own id.
One way to generate a UUID is to create a UUID once by running the 
\fBuuidgen\fP tool.
.TP
.B \-\-gstout\-audiosink 
.B \-\-gstout\-audiodevice
Set the audio sink and audio device

These options allow the user to configure the where the sound output from 
\fBgmediarender\fP is sent.  The correct values will depend on which 
method of audio output (e.g. ALSA) is being used.  The 
\fB\-\-help\-gstout\fP option provides information on possible values
for these options.
.TP
.B \-\-help-gstout
lists possible values for the \fB\-\-gstout-...\fP optiosns above.
.TP
.B \-\-gstout\-initial\-volume\-db
Sets the initial volume on startup in decibels.

Values range from 0 (maximum volume) to \-60 (minimum volume. The decibel 
scale is non\-linear: \-20db represnts rooughly half volume.  The 
default value is 0.

Note that this does not
influence the hardware (e.g. ALSA) volume level, but only internal attenuation.
It is advisable to set the hardware level to 100\% where possible.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-daemon
Runs the program as a daemon.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-pid\-file \<pidfile\>                    
Name of the file which the process ID should be written to.
.TP
.B \-\-logfile \<logfile\>              
Name of a file to log output of the program to.  To log to the terminal use
use \-\-logfile \/dev\/stdout
This file can get quite large over time, so it is only recommended to use
this option for debugging purposes.
